I tried learning django  while making this website however i could not learn it completely in the given time. With all the knowledge i had + using brute force I made a password protected website using javascript
My main strength being front end I gave a decent/good design to the website using lots of bootstrap and tailblocks,  and tried making the website password protected using javascript
I fully understand requirement of the assignment was to develop your backend skills and this certainly don't meet the requirements however I wanted to show you this website as i believe something is better than nothing

I have written the password just below so that you don't need to search for it
